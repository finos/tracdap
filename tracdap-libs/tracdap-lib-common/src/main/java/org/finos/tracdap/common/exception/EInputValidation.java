 * A validation error during initial validation of request inputs

 * Input validation errors refer to the first phase of validation, which is
 * validation of fixed inputs. This validation refers to inputs in isolation,
 * i.e. as a static object tree with no references to other versions or referenced
 * objects. As such, input validations are always a result of invalid requests and
 * are reported as ILLEGAL_ARGUMENT errors.
