/**
 * Data is considered corrupt when it cannot be understood according to its own format
 *
 * How corrupt data is detected depends on the data format. For example, for JSON text data,
 * a data stream might be corrupt if it contains an invalid Unicode sequence, or if the JSON
 * fails to parse, for example because of a missing brace. For binary formats can occur in the
 * structure of the binary data stream and will be detected if that data stream cannot be
 * understood.
 *
 * Data corruption does not include data constraints, such as non-null or range constraints,
 * which are reported as EDataConstraint.
