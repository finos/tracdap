/**
 * Thrown when a cache entry has become corrupt
 *
 * <p>This error indicates that an individual cache entry has become corrupt and is no longer
 * readable. TRAC will try to handle this error so that individual corrupt entries do not
 * pollute the cache and stop it from functioning. For cache query operations corrupt
 * entries will be returned with no value, cacheError() will return an ECacheCorruption error.
 * Calls to getEntry() will throw this exception if the entry is corrupt.
 *
 * <p>One cause of cache corruption is jobs in the cache that reference old class files.
 * This could happen after the upgrade of an executor plugin, if there are incompatible
 * changes in the executor state class. Although TRAC has error handling to clean up affected
 * jobs, executors should take care when updating their state classes to avoid this issue.</p>
