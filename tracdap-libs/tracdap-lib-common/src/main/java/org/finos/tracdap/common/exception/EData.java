/**
 * Indicates a problem with data held by or presented to TRAC
 *
 * Data errors relate to the data itself. Examples include
 * - Data does not pass quality or validation checks
 * - Data is in the wrong format
 * - Contents of a data file has become corrupt
 *
 * This is distinct from a storage error, which indicates a problem communicating with the underlying
 * storage technology. Storage errors can generally be corrected by resolving issues in the technology
 * stack, where data errors will require changes to data (or restoring from backup in the case of corruption).
 *
 * Because data errors relate to the content of the data itself,
 * these are business-meaningful errors and should be reported to end users.
