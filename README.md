*A next-generation data and analytics platform for use in highly regulated environments*

TRAC D.A.P. brings a step change in performance, insight, flexibility and control 
compared to conventional analytics platforms. By redrawing the boundary
between business and technology, modellers and business users are given easy
access to modern, open source tools that can execute at scale, while technology
integrations and operational concerns are cleanly separated and consolidated
across use cases.

At the core of a platform, a flexible metadata model allows data and models to
be catalogued, plugged together and shared across the business. Using the
principal of immutability, TRAC allows new data structures and model pipelines
to be created, updated and executed at any time without change risk to production
workflows, guaranteeing total repeatability, audit and control (TRAC).


## Documentation and Packages

Documentation for the TRAC platform is available on our website at
[tracdap.finos.org](https://tracdap.finos.org).

The following packages are available:

The current release series (0.4.x) is intended for model development and prototyping.
It provides an end-to-end workflow to build and run individual models in a local
environment. It also provides the platform APIs needed to build client applications
such as web tools or system client system integrations.

The TRAC metadata structures and API calls are mostly complete. Metadata compatibility
is ensured within a release series starting from version 0.4.0 - the 0.4.x series
will be compatible with 0.4.0 but changes may be introduced in 0.5.0. The metadata
model will continue to stabilise before eventually being frozen for version 1.0.0,
after which it may be added to but no fields will be removed or changed.

For more information see the
[development roadmap](https://github.com/finos/tracdap/wiki/Development-Roadmap).

## Building TRAC

The core platform services require Java version 11 or higher, using LTS 11 or LTS 17
is recommended. Suitable JDKs are available from Azul and Adoptium:

* [Azul - Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk)
* [Adoptium - Eclipse Temurin](https://adoptium.net/)

To build the TRAC platform, clone the repository and run this command
in the source directory:

    gradlew build     # Windows
    ./gradlew build   # Linux or macOS
    
If you are behind a corporate firewall, you may need to use a web proxy and/or
point Gradle at a Nexus server hosted inside your network to download 
dependencies. The Gradle documentation explains how to declare a local mirror
in an init script, so that it can be used for all Gradle builds.

* [Gradle web proxy](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_environment.html#sec:accessing_the_web_via_a_proxy)
* [Gradle init scripts](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/init_scripts.html)
* [Gradle repo declarations](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_repositories.html)


## Running TRAC

In order to run TRAC you will need to supply some configuration. There is a
sample "devlocal" configuration included in the "etc" folder which is set up
to use a local backend with data stored under build/run.

Before starting the TRAC services you will need to create a metadata database.
There is a tool provided that can deploy the schema and create tenants. To use
the "devlocal" setup the supplied config can be used as-is, this will deploy
the TRAC metadata schema into an H2 database file.

    gradlew :deploy-metadb:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal.yaml --task deploy_schema"
    gradlew :deploy-metadb:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal.yaml --task add_tenant:ACME_CORP"

To run models in TRAC you will need an execution environment. A local execution
environment for can be configured by creating a Python venv and installing the
TRAC D.A.P. runtime, then editing trac-devlocal.yaml to set the executor venvPath.

    python -m vemv path/to/venv/
    . path/to/venv/bin/activate     # For macOS and Linux
    path\to\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
    pip install tracdap-runtime

Once you have a database and an executor prepared, you can start the TRAC services.

    gradlew :tracdap-svc-meta:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal.yaml"
    gradlew :tracdap-svc-data:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal.yaml"
    gradlew :tracdap-svc-orch:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal.yaml"
    gradlew :tracdap-gateway:run --args="--config etc/trac-devlocal-gateway.yaml"

To confirm the platform is working you can use the [example API calls](./examples/rest_calls)
with a REST client such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/). For more information on the
platform APIs and how to use them to build applications, check out the
[application development section](https://tracdap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/app_dev)
in the online documentation.
