Platform Deployment
===================


The TRAC platform components are available to download on the GitHub release page:

* https://github.com/finos/tracdap/releases

You want the tracdap-platform TGZ file, which includes distributions for all the
platform services as well as supporting tools suitable for deploying in a container
or on physical or virtual infrastructure. All the packages are platform-agnostic.

We are working on documentation including guides and examples for different deployment configurations.
If you need help in the meantime, please `get in touch <https://github.com/finos/tracdap/issues>`_.
