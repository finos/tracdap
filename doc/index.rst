    *A next-generation data and analytics platform for use in highly regulated environments*
	

.. note::
	We are building the documentation for TRAC in tandem with the open source version of the
	platform, both are in active deveopment. This documentaiton is presented in the hope that 
	it will be useful before it is complete!
	
	You can see the current development status and roadmap for the platform on the
	`roadmap page <https://github.com/Accenture/trac/wiki/Development-Roadmap>`_.
