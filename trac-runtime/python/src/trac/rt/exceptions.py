    in some technical errors being classed as EModelExec, e.g. Spark communication failures during model execution.

    This exception is not used for TRAC errors, e.g. validation or storage errors, which have their own exceptions.
    Error types that extend BaseException instead of Exception will not be wrapped; this specifically includes
