# Code gen creates outputs under artificial locations:
#
#   trac.rt_gen.domain.trac.metadata - TRAC domain objects for the runtime API
#   trac.rt_gen.proto.trac.metadata - Output of Google's native protoc for Python
#
# The generator respects the package layout of the source .proto files, however
# having the top level trac namespace defined in two source roots means only one
# set of packages gets imported. When the TRAC package is distributed we can get
# around this by copying the output of the generator under the correct locations
# in the package, which will be as follows:
#
#   trac.rt_gen.domain.trac.metadata -> trac.rt.metadata
#   trac.rt_gen.proto.trac.metadata -> trac.rt.proto
#
# This proxy import means the API will work as expected during development
# without needing to run packaging jobs.

from trac.rt_gen.domain.trac.metadata import *  # noqa
