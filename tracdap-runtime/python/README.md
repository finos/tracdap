# TRAC Model Runtime for Python

*TRAC D.A.P. is a next-generation data and analytics platform for use in highly regulated environments*

The TRAC model runtime provides all the APIs needed to write models for the TRAC platform.
It includes an implementation of the runtime library that can be used as a development
sandbox, so you can run and debug TRAC models right away from your favourite IDE or notebook.
A number of tools are included to make it easy to plug in development data and configuration.
When your models are ready they can be loaded into a real instance of TRAC for testing and
eventual deployment.

Documentation for the TRAC platform is available on our website at
[tracdap.finos.org](https://tracdap.finos.org).

## Requirements

The TRAC runtime for Python has these requirements:

* Python: 3.7 or later
* Pandas: 1.2 or later
* PySpark 2.4.x or 3.x

Not every combination of versions will work, e.g. PySpark 3 requires Python 3.8.


## Installing the runtime

The TRAC runtime package can be installed directly from PyPI:

    pip install tracdap-runtime

The TRAC runtime depends on Pandas and PySpark, so these libraries will be pulled in as 
dependencies. If you want to target particular versions, install them explicitly first.


## Writing a model

Once the runtime is installed you can write your first TRAC model! Start by
inheriting the TracModel base class, your IDE should be able to generate stubs for you:

    import tracdap.rt.api as trac

    class SampleModel(trac.TracModel):

        def define_parameters(self) -> tp.Dict[str, trac.ModelParameter]:
            pass

        def define_inputs(self) -> tp.Dict[str, trac.ModelInputSchema]:
            pass

        def define_outputs(self) -> tp.Dict[str, trac.ModelOutputSchema]:
            pass

        def run_model(self, ctx: trac.TracContext):
            pass

You can fill in the three define_* methods to declare any parameters, inputs and outputs your
model is going to need, then start writing your model code in run_model.

To learn about modelling with TRAC D.A.P. and what is possible, check out the
[modelling tutorials](https://tracdap.readthedocs.io/en/stable/modelling/tutorial)
available in our online documentation. The tutorials are based on
[example models](https://github.com/finos/tracdap/tree/main/examples/models/python)
in the TRAC GitHub repository. We run these examples as part of our CI, so they will always
be in sync with the corresponding version of the runtime library.


## Building the runtime from source

This is not normally necessary for model development, but if you want to do it here are the commands.

    cd tracdap-runtime/python

    # Configure a Python environment

    python -m venv ./venv
    venv\Scripts\activate              # For Windows platforms
    . venv/bin/activate                # For macOS or Linux
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Build the Python package files

    python ./build_runtime.py --target dist
    
The package files will appear under build/dist
