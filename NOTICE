Third Party Components - SQL (JDBC) drivers
===========================================

TRAC supports a number of SQL dialects, by means of JDBC "drivers" added to the classpath.
SQL drivers can be enabled for development in the Gradle config file "gradle/plugins.gradle".
Any drivers that are enabled may only be used under the terms of their respective licenses.
If you are planning to redistribute TRAC you should be aware of the legal implications of
adjusting these settings for a release build.

TRAC may be built with support for all SQL drivers disabled, as SQL drivers can be supplied
at run time. By building the platform this way, it is not combined with any driver code.
All the public releases of TRAC D.A.P. are built in this way. A person or organisation deploying
the platform will be able to supply SQL drivers under their own license terms.

There is a plugins package released with each public release of TRAC D.A.P. This plugins package
contains some of the available SQL drivers, licensed under there own terms, where licensing
conditions allow.
