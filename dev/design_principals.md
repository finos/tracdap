Some basic but desirable attributes of a modelling / application platform, in
rough order of priority. These are intended to help inform technology and design
choices. Suggestions / discussion are very welcome!

1. Ease of use (in order of priority)

    * For end users
    * For application developers
    * For modellers
    * For platform administrators
    * For platform developers
    
2. Documentation: More is better

3. Simplicity (should always be on the list)!

   * As simple as possible, but no simpler

4. Prefer open standards

5. Minimise dependencies

6. API design

    * Self-describing 
    * Consistent
    * Un-opinionated (outside the core precepts of the design)
    * Enable / encourage intended patterns

7. Component design

    * Clean division of responsibility along functional lines
    * Stateless & functional where possible (do not mix code and data)!
    * The right level of descriptiveness / verbosity (not too much, not too little)
