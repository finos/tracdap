# GeneralChartConfig config set up

### defaultTenant

This is the default tenant that the application will set to. If this tenant does not exist then the application will
error as it is required to make API calls to TRAC. The user can select a different tenant using the settings modal in
the top right of the screen. This sets a cookie in the browser for the user's preferred tenant.
