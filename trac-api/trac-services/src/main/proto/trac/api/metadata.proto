/**
 * Public API reading, writing and searching for objects in the TRAC metadata store.
 *
 * The TRAC metadata API is expressed in terms of Objects and Tags. Objects are
 * structural items (nouns and verbs) such as data, models and jobs that describe
 * resources and operations on the TRAC platform. Tags contain descriptive and
 * informational data and provide a means to classify, catalogue and control objects.
 * Tags can also be used to describe the structure of applications built on the TRAC
 * platform. For more information on the TRAC metadata model, refer to the
 * documentation for ObjectDefinition and Tag.
 *
 * The write API allows objects to be created directly, by supplying an object
 * definition and a set of tags. These definitions and tags are validated,
 * assigned an ID and version (in a tag header) then saved as they are. Only
 * certain types of objects can be created / updated directly via the public API
 * (currently FLOW and CUSTOM objects). Other types of objects are created by TRAC
 * as a result of operations on the platform, for example a model import job will
 * create a model definition.
 *
 * Creating a new version of an object is very similar to creating a new object,
 * in that the entire metadata definition must be supplied. TRAC will perform
 * validation to make sure the new definition is a valid version update from the
 * previous version - the semantics of versioning depend on the particular object
 * type.
 *
 * The metadata write API also provides a means for updating tags (i.e. creating
 * a new tag version); tag updates are allowed for all object types via the public
 * API. The current API requires a whole new tag to be supplied, this will be
 * replaced in a future version with an API that supplies attributes changes as a
 * set of add/modify/remove operations.
 *
 * The read API is for reading metadata from the metadata store when the IDs of the
 * metadata items are known. The easiest way to read metadata is using TagSelectors,
 * which may be present in other metadata items (e.g. job definitions record tag
 * selectors to indicate which versions of resources were used in a job) or can be
 * easily constructed from an object ID or tag header. HTTP GET calls are also
 * available for REST clients (REST clients can still use selectors with POST
 * requests).
 *
 * Metadata searches are performed using tag attributes, as well as an object type
 * and a few top-level parameters to handle versioning and temporality. See the
 * SearchParameters object for a more detailed description. The result of a search
 * call is a list of matching tags, which are always arranged with the most recent
 * tags first. A search that matches no results will return an empty list.
 *
 * This API is a multi-tenant API. For gRPC requests every request includes a
 * tenant code, for REST requests the tenant code is the first element of every
 * path.
