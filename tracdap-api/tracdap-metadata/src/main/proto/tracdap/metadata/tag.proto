/**
 * Tags are the core informational element of TRAC's metadata model.
 *
 * A tag is a set of attributes (key-value pairs) associated with an object
 * definition, intended for storing descriptive and informational data as well
 * as application-level metadata that is not part of the object definition model.
 * Here is an example of a set of tag attributes to illustrate some ways they can
 * be used::
 *
 *     # A descriptive field intended for human users.
 *
 *     display_name: "Customer accounts for March 2020, corrected April 6th"
 *
 *     # A classification that can be used for searching or indexing.
 *     # Client applications can also use this to find datasets of a certain
 *     # type; typically an application will define a set of attributes that are
 *     # "structural", i.e. the application uses those attributes to decide which
 *     # objects to present for certain purposes.
 *
 *     dataset_class: "customer_accounts"
 *
 *     # Properties of an item can be added as individual attributes so they can
 *     # be searched and displayed individually. This avoids the anti-pattern of
 *     # putting multiple attributes into a single name/label field:
 *     #    customer_accounts_mar20_scotland_commercial_approved
 *
 *     accounting_date: (DATE) 2020-03-31
 *     region: "Scotland"
 *     book: "commercial_property"
 *     figures_approved: (BOOLEAN) true
 *
 *     # Attributes can be multi-valued. This can be helpful for applying
 *     # regulatory classifiers, where multiple classifiers may apply to a
 *     # single item.
 *
 *     data_classification: ["confidential", "gdpr_pii", "audited"]
 *
 *     # TRAC records a number of "controlled" attributes, these are set by the
 *     # platform and cannot be modified directly through the metadata API.
 *     # Controlled attributes start with the prefix "trac_".
 *
 *     trac_create_time: (DATETIME) 2020-04-01 10:37:05
 *     trac_create_user_id: "jane.doe"
 *     trac_create_user_name: "Jane Doe"
 *
 * Tags use immutable versioning in the same way as objects - each version of a
 * tag is immutable and "updating" a tag means creating a new version with one or
 * more modified attributes. Each version of an object has its own series of tags
 * starting at tag version 1.
 *
 * As an example of this versioning, consider a partitioned dataset with daily
 * account records. Version X of the dataset contains data up to a certain date
 * and might have a tag saying it is signed off. A user/process then adds a new
 * partition with the next day's data, creating version X+1. In this case, object
 * version X would still be signed off while version X+1 is awaiting approval.
 * When version X+1 is approved, the tag for that version can be "updated". The
 * application could decide whether to show the most recent version of the data,
 * or an earlier version that has the sign-off attribute set.

     * interpreted as multi-valued attributes). Any attribute may be single- or
