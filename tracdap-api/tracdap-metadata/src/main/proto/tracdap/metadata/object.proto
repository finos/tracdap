/**
 * Object definitions are the core structural element of TRAC's metadata model
 *
 * Definitions describe every object that is stored in the TRAC platform and there
 * is a one-to-one relation between definitions and objects. I.e. every dataset
 * has its own data definition, every model has its own model definition and so
 * on. Definitions also describe actions that take place on the platform by way of
 * job definitions, so a "job" is just another type of object. Each type of object
 * has its own definition and definitions can be added or extended as the platform
 * evolves.
 *
 * The object definition container class allows different types of objects to be
 * stored, indexed and accessed in the same way. Every object has a standard
 * object header which contains enough information to identify the object.
 *
 * TRAC object definitions can be versioned. In order to use versioning the
 * semantics of versioning must be defined and those vary depending on the object
 * type. Currently these semantics are defined for DATA objects, see
 * DataDefinition for details. Versioning is also allowed for CUSTOM objects, in
 * this case it is the responsibility of the application to define versioning
 * semantics. Versioning is not currently permitted for other object types.
 *
 * Object definitions are intended for storing structural data necessary to access
 * data and run jobs on the TRAC platform. Informational data to catalogue and
 * describe objects is stored in tags. Tags are a lot more flexible than object
 * definitions, so applications built on the TRAC platform may choose to store
 * structural information in tags where their required structure is not supported
 * by TRAC's core object definitions.
